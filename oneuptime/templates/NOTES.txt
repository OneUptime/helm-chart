OneUptime is now installed. Please wait for all the services to spin up. 

You can check pod status by using this command: 

kubectl get pods --namespace={{ $.Release.Namespace }}

One all the pods are running. You can check the service status to see if the IP is assigned to the nginx service. 

kubectl get svc --namespace={{ $.Release.Namespace }} {{ $.Release.Name }}-nginx 

You should then be able to access OneUptime cluster with that IP. Please make sure your host matches the host set in values.yaml which currently is {{ .Values.host }}. If you would like to change this host to another value, please do a helm upgrade.
